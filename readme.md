## Description 
Welcome to Ocean Driven, a web application that allows users to book boats listed by other users. The goal for this project was to create a full MERN stack PWA with a major focus on user interaction and convenience. This was accomplished with the use of MongoDB for our database storage and React for our client-side rendering. This application also incorporates ChakraUI to create a visually appealing UI.
